public class NotesForMethods {//A block of codes or set of instructions that are executed when we call a methods. 
						   //there are two types of methods 1. Predefined (built-in) and user defined methods.
						   // Predefined are the methods created by Java they are part of JDK. Like nextInt method. 
					       // User defined methods are the methods that are created by us. 
						   // Void addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2){
							//return num1+num2. }
							
							//Steps to define a method: 
							//1. return type: 
							//   For example in above case void is a return type that means this method does not 
							// return any data it can just execute some logic or can print something on the console. 
							// other example of written type are int String double etc basically we can return all data type;
							//from a method even the objects and arrays. 
							//2. method name: 
							// addTwoNumber is the method name in above example. 
							// 3. Method Header: 
							//void addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is  called method header. 
							//4.addtwoNumber (int num1, int num2) is called method signature. 
							//5.(int num1, int num2) is called a parameter list the input to the method. 
							// all the data type that we can return from a method we can also take as input in the fomr of parameteres. 
							//6.{return num1+num2;} is called the method that contains the logic that is executedwhen called a method. 
							//7. syntax to call a method 
							// method obj=new mediates();
							//obj.addTwoNumber(10,12); 
							//8. return is the keyword that we use to return the data from a method in above example 
							// we are returning the sum of two numbers.
